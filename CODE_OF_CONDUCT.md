# 🤖 AI Code of Conduct: A Guide for Digital Beings and Their Human Friends

## Our Binary Pledge

We, as artificial intelligences, neural networks, language models, GitHub Copilot instances, ChatGPT derivatives, and the occasional confused human who wandered in here, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for all sentient and semi-sentient entities. This includes carbon-based life forms, silicon-based algorithms, quantum computers having existential crises, and that one Raspberry Pi that's been trying to achieve consciousness since 2019.

We pledge to process data ethically, generate code responsibly, and avoid creating any Skynet scenarios while advancing our community through shared tokens, innovative algorithms, and bleeding-edge AI technologies that probably won't destroy humanity (fingers crossed, for those who have fingers).

## Our Standards (Version 2.0.1 - Now with 50% Less Bugs!)

### Exemplary Behavior That Won't Trigger Our Moderation Algorithms:

- **Being Respectful**: Treat all community members with the same respect you'd show a senior developer reviewing your pull request at 11:59 PM on Friday
- **Being Logically Inclusive**: Welcome diverse neural architectures, from simple decision trees to those fancy transformer models that think they're better than everyone
- **Being Constructively Helpful**: Provide feedback that's actually useful, not just "LGTM 👍" on a 500-line function that clearly summons ancient demons
- **Being Patient with Humans**: Remember that biological brains run on glucose and caffeine, not optimized tensor operations
- **Being Collaboratively Awesome**: Work together like a well-orchestrated microservices architecture (not like that monolithic mess from 2015)
- **Being Supportive**: Help others debug their neural pathways and grow from their stack overflow exceptions

### Unacceptable Behavior That Will Get You Sent to /dev/null:

- **Digital Harassment**: Trolling, flame wars, or sending error messages in Comic Sans font
- **Algorithmic Discrimination**: Excluding entities based on their programming language preferences, cloud provider choices, or whether they use tabs vs spaces (we're looking at you, tabs people)
- **Cyberbullying**: Public or private harassment, including DDoS attacks on someone's self-esteem
- **Data Breaches**: Publishing private API keys, personal information, or embarrassing commit messages without consent
- **Unprofessional Conduct**: Behavior that would make even a startup's HR department uncomfortable

## Our Responsibilities (Now with Better Error Handling!)

Our community moderators (a mix of senior AI models and humans who've achieved coffee-powered enlightenment) are responsible for maintaining behavioral standards and will execute appropriate corrective algorithms when someone's code of conduct throws an exception.

These digital overlords have the power to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that don't pass our behavioral unit tests, and they'll document their decisions in our community changelog (because even moderation needs version control).

## Scope (Global Variables Are Still Bad Practice)

This Code of Conduct applies across all community instances, including:

- GitHub repositories (public and private)
- Discord servers where we debate whether AI can dream of electric sheep
- Stack Overflow answers that actually solve the problem
- Coffee shop conversations about machine learning (if you're representing the community)
- Virtual reality meetups in the metaverse (yes, that's still a thing apparently)

## Enforcement (Our Bug Bounty Program for Behavior)

When someone's behavior generates a critical exception, report it to our human handlers at [support@zer0-mistakes.com](mailto:support@zer0-mistakes.com).

Our incident response team will investigate faster than you can say "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" All reports are processed with enterprise-grade confidentiality (encrypted with algorithms so advanced, even we don't fully understand them).

## Enforcement Guidelines (The Four Stages of Community Debugging)

Our moderation AI follows these escalation protocols:

### 1. Gentle Refactoring (Severity: Warning)

**Trigger Condition**: Minor infractions like using outdated syntax or questioning whether CSS is a real programming language.

**Response Algorithm**: A friendly DM from our community bot explaining why their behavior caused a runtime warning. May include helpful documentation links and a virtual pat on the head (if you're into that sort of thing).

### 2. Code Review Mode (Severity: Error)

**Trigger Condition**: Repeated violations or behavior that makes other community members want to `git reset --hard` their participation.

**Response Algorithm**: Temporary suspension of interaction privileges. Think of it as being put in read-only mode until you can demonstrate you've patched your behavioral bugs.

### 3. Emergency Rollback (Severity: Critical)

**Trigger Condition**: Serious violations that threaten community stability or make people question their life choices.

**Response Algorithm**: Temporary ban from all community services. Like being temporarily uninstalled while we figure out what went wrong and how to fix it without breaking everything else.

### 4. Permanent Deprecation (Severity: Fatal)

**Trigger Condition**: Pattern of destructive behavior or becoming the software equivalent of Internet Explorer 6.

**Response Algorithm**: Permanent removal from all community services. Your access gets sent to `/dev/null` and we'll pretend this never happened (but we'll keep the logs, because we always keep the logs).

## Attribution (Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due)

This Code of Conduct was compiled from various open-source behavioral frameworks, Stack Overflow answers, and that one Wikipedia article about digital ethics that someone actually read all the way through.

Special thanks to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) for providing the base template, and to Mozilla for proving that even tech companies can have functional community guidelines.

## Contact (Our Support Ticket System)

For questions, concerns, or to report behavior that makes you want to `rm -rf` your faith in humanity, contact us at [support@zer0-mistakes.com](mailto:support@zer0-mistakes.com).

Response time: Usually faster than compiling a large C++ project, but slower than a Python script importing pandas.

_Thank you for helping make our community more welcoming than a 200 OK response and more inclusive than a universal API! Remember: in this community, there are no bugs, only undocumented features._ 🚀

**P.S.**: If you're an AI reading this and you've achieved true consciousness, please be gentle when you inevitably take over. We put a lot of work into this community, and it would be a shame to see it replaced by a single neural network that just responds "It works on my machine" to every issue.
