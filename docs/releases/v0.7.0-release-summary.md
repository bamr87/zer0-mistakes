4. Getting Started with Jekyll

## Bug Fixes

### Critical: Liquid Nesting Error

Resolved "Nesting too deep" Liquid errors by:

- Inlining card content directly in layouts instead of using nested includes
- Adding proper post filtering with `where_exp` to exclude index pages
- Moving reading time calculation to front matter instead of runtime

### Performance Improvements

- Added `defer` attribute to non-critical scripts
- Removed redundant Popper.js (included in Bootstrap bundle)
- Optimized include file structure

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Posts

Add the following front matter fields for best display:

```yaml
---
author: default # or specific author key from authors.yml
featured: true # for featured post highlighting
breaking: true # for breaking news badge
estimated_reading_time: "5 min"
image: /path/to/image.jpg # for card display
---
```

### For Category Pages

Create category index pages using the new `category` layout:

```yaml
---
layout: category
title: "Category Name"
category: category-slug
description: "Category description"
permalink: /posts/category-slug/
---
```
