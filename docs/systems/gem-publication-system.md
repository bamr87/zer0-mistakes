# 🚀 Gem Publication System Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive gem publication system for Jekyll Theme Zer0, including VS Code integration and automatic changelog generation.

## 📁 New Publication Script

### `gem-publish.sh` - Comprehensive Publication Workflow

The new comprehensive script that handles the entire gem publication process:

```bash
./scripts/gem-publish.sh [patch|minor|major] [options]
```

#### Key Features:

- 📋 **Automatic Changelog Generation**: Analyzes commit history since last version
- 🔢 **Semantic Versioning**: Handles patch, minor, and major version bumps
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Runs full test suite before publication
- 📦 **Gem Building & Validation**: Builds and validates gem packages
- 🚀 **RubyGems Publication**: Publishes to RubyGems.org
- 🏷️ **GitHub Releases**: Creates GitHub releases with assets
- 🔄 **Git Integration**: Handles commits, tags, and repository synchronization

#### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch

# Minor release (new features)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh major

# Preview what would happen (dry run)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch --dry-run

# Skip publishing (development testing)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch --skip-publish --no-github-release

# Non-interactive mode (CI/CD)
./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch --non-interactive
```

## 📋 Automatic Changelog Generation

### Commit Categorization

The system automatically categorizes commits based on conventional commit prefixes:

#### Added (New Features)

```bash
feat: add user authentication system
feature(api): implement rate limiting
```

#### Fixed (Bug Fixes)

```bash
fix: resolve memory leak in parser
bugfix(ui): correct button alignment issue
```

#### Changed (Modifications)

```bash
chore: update dependencies
refactor: improve code organization
perf: optimize database queries
style: fix code formatting
docs: update API documentation
test: add integration tests
ci: update workflow configuration
build: improve build process
```

#### Security (Security Updates)

```bash
security: patch XSS vulnerability
sec: update authentication tokens
```

#### Deprecated & Removed

```bash
# Deprecated - any commit containing "deprecat"
# Removed
remove: delete legacy API endpoints
rm: clean up unused files
```

### Generated Changelog Format

```markdown

## 🚦 Complete Workflow Process

### 1. Environment Validation

- Checks git repository status (must be clean)
- Validates required files exist
- Confirms RubyGems authentication
- Verifies command availability

### 2. Changelog Generation

- Analyzes commit history since last version tag
- Categories commits by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, etc.)
- Generates structured changelog entry
- Updates CHANGELOG.md file
- Shows preview for review

### 3. Version Management

- Reads current version from `lib/jekyll-theme-zer0/version.rb`
- Calculates new version based on type (patch/minor/major)
- Updates version in Ruby version file and package.json

### 4. Testing & Building

- Runs comprehensive test suite (`bundle exec rspec`)
- Validates gemspec syntax
- Builds gem package
- Shows package summary

### 5. Publication

- Checks for version conflicts on RubyGems
- Publishes gem to RubyGems.org
- Creates git commit and tag
- Generates GitHub release with gem asset

### 6. Repository Synchronization

- Pushes changes to repository
- Pushes tags to repository
- Updates remote tracking

## 🔧 Prerequisites & Setup

### Required Tools

```bash
# Check if tools are available
which git ruby gem bundle jq gh
```

### Authentication Setup

```bash
# RubyGems authentication
gem signin

# GitHub CLI authentication (for releases)
gh auth login
```

### File Requirements

- `lib/jekyll-theme-zer0/version.rb` - Version definition
- `jekyll-theme-zer0.gemspec` - Gem specification
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Changelog file
- Clean git working directory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Working directory is not clean"

```bash
git status           # Check what's uncommitted
git add . && git commit -m "commit message"
# or
git stash           # Temporarily stash changes
```

#### "Not authenticated with RubyGems"

```bash
gem signin          # Sign in to RubyGems.org
```

#### "Version already exists"

The script prevents republishing existing versions - you need to bump the version number first.

#### "Tests failed"

Fix test failures before proceeding, or use `--skip-tests` for emergency releases (not recommended).

### Debug Mode

```bash
bash -x ./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch --dry-run
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- Prevents republishing existing versions
- Requires clean git working directory
- Validates gem contents before publishing
- Confirms user intent for destructive operations
- API keys managed securely (RubyGems credentials, GitHub CLI)

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Development (Quick Testing)

1. Use **⚡ Gem: Quick Build & Test** task or launch config
2. This generates changelog, bumps version, runs tests, builds gem
3. But skips publishing to RubyGems

### For Preview (See What Would Happen)

1. Use **🔍 Gem: Dry Run Preview** task or launch config
2. Shows exactly what changes would be made
3. Great for reviewing changelog generation

### For Real Releases

1. Ensure working directory is clean
2. Use appropriate release type:
   - **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes
   - **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
   - **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
3. Use launch config or run: `./scripts/gem-publish.sh [type]`

### Access Methods

#### Via VS Code Debug Panel (F5)

1. Open VS Code
2. Press F5 or go to Run & Debug panel
3. Select desired gem publication configuration
4. Click play button

#### Via VS Code Task Runner

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select desired gem task from the list

#### Via Terminal

```bash
cd /path/to/zer0-mistakes
./scripts/gem-publish.sh patch --dry-run
```
