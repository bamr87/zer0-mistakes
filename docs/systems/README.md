## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
1. **Dependency Issues**
   - Check package versions and compatibility
   - Update dependencies and test locally
   - Verify Docker environment consistency

2. **Test Failures**
   - Review test logs and error messages
   - Run tests locally to reproduce issues
   - Check for environment-specific problems
