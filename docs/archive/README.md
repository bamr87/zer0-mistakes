  - Initial requirements and design decisions
  - Architecture proposals
  - Implementation roadmap

## Current Documentation

The information from these archived files has been consolidated into:

**[docs/systems/release-automation.md](../systems/release-automation.md)** - Complete Release Automation System Documentation

This consolidated guide includes:
- Quick start and installation
- Complete architecture overview
- 10-step release workflow
- Command reference and examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Migration instructions
- Development guidelines
- Complete modernization history

## Why These Were Archived

These phase documents served as progress tracking during the modernization project but became redundant after completion. The content has been:

1. **Integrated** into permanent documentation
2. **Organized** by topic rather than chronology
3. **Enhanced** with additional context and examples
4. **Cross-referenced** throughout documentation system

## Historical Context
