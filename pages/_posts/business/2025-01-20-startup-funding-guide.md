Starting a business is exciting, but securing funding can be one of the most challenging aspects of entrepreneurship. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the various stages of startup funding and help you understand which options are best for your business.

## Understanding Funding Stages

### Pre-Seed Funding

Pre-seed funding is often the earliest stage of funding, typically coming from:

- **Personal savings** - Bootstrapping your idea
- **Friends and family** - Initial believers in your vision
- **Angel investors** - Individual investors who provide capital for startups

At this stage, you're usually raising between $10,000 to $250,000 to validate your concept.

### Seed Funding

Seed funding helps you plant the seeds of your business:

```
Typical Seed Round:
- Amount: $500K - $2M
- Equity: 10-25%
- Timeline: 3-6 months to close
- Use: Product development, initial hiring
```

### Series A and Beyond

As your startup grows, you'll progress through additional funding rounds:

| Round | Typical Amount | Focus |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Series A | $2M - $15M | Scaling product-market fit |
| Series B | $15M - $50M | Expanding market reach |
| Series C+ | $50M+ | Aggressive growth/IPO prep |

## Key Metrics Investors Look For

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** - Predictable income stream
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - How much to acquire each customer
3. **Lifetime Value (LTV)** - Total revenue from a customer
4. **Burn Rate** - Monthly cash expenditure
5. **Runway** - Months until funds run out

## Building Your Pitch Deck

A compelling pitch deck should include:

- Problem statement
- Your solution
- Market opportunity
- Business model
- Traction and metrics
- Team background
- Financial projections
- The ask

## Conclusion

Raising capital is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on building a great product, understanding your metrics, and telling a compelling story that resonates with investors.
