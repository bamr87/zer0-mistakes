Web accessibility isn't just a legal requirement—it's about creating inclusive experiences for everyone. This guide covers essential accessibility practices for modern web development.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Over 1 billion people worldwide have some form of disability. Making your website accessible:

- **Expands your audience**: Reach more users
- **Improves SEO**: Accessible sites rank better
- **Enhances usability**: Benefits all users
- **Ensures compliance**: Meet legal requirements

## Core Principles (POUR)

### 1. Perceivable

Users must be able to perceive the information:

- Provide text alternatives for images
- Offer captions for videos
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable

### 2. Operable

Users must be able to operate the interface:

- Keyboard accessible
- No seizure-inducing content
- Navigable structure
- Enough time to complete tasks

### 3. Understandable

Content must be understandable:

- Readable text
- Predictable behavior
- Input assistance
- Error prevention

### 4. Robust

Content must work with various technologies:

- Valid HTML
- Name, role, value for components
- Status messages announced

## Quick Wins

1. **Use semantic HTML**: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`
2. **Add alt text**: Describe images meaningfully
3. **Check contrast**: Use tools like WebAIM
4. **Test keyboard navigation**: Tab through your site
5. **Add ARIA labels**: Where semantic HTML isn't enough
